# NLP
This repo contains some foundational NLP architectures written from scratch in pytorch 

> Transformer encoder notebook is the goto implemention of pytorch bert architecture

> VAE aka variational autoencoder is implemented on mnist dataset to understand the network architecture 

> Bert_tf_structure : This folder contains all the BERT modules implemented in pytorch , the main.py attenpts to load tensorflow  
trained bert model on pytorch architecture , to verify the implementation 

> For converting tensorflow weights to pytorch , each layer of tensorflow has been mapped to the pytorch layers .
